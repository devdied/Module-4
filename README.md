* The analysis was performed for the district schools to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. The analysis involves finding the 5 high performing and 5 low performing schools in terms of their overall passing percentage for Math and Reading courses. The analysis also includes trends for:
    * Math scores by their grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th)
    * Reading scores by their grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th)
    * Scores by School Spending
    * Scores by School Size
    * Scores by School Type (District, Charter)

Conclusion:
* The lower the school spends on its students, more likely its students perform better
* The bigger school size, the lower overall passing scores
* Charter school students perform better than District school students
